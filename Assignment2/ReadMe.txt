Add items into cart. Cart can be cleared at anytime on the main page.

When you click purchase, you need to login.

Then you view your info and cart info.

I have not figured how to process the cart with the db but it is partially setup. This is when it should check the db to check quantities and do the correct tasks based on that info. One task would be rejecting the order if you want to order too much or process it completely if it is within stock range and updates stock.

I commented some of code out in order to get my assignment to work to get pictures.
